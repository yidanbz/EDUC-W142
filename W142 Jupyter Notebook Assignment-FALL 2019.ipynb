    "In this assignment you will be examining an international dataset from The World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) to explore the powerful influence of social categories (such as wealth, ethnicity, and location) on childrenâ€™s opportunities for a quality education and life based on their gender in the country you choose to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE for Track B students only: You will continue to build on this assignment and work with the same person for the final group project (if you elected to work in a pair; if you elected to work individually please be sure to talk to the person you will be working with for the final group project so you can pick the same country).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After viewing the Jupyter tutorial, please use the WIDE dataset to begin to identify, through analysis and data visualizations who are the most marginalized children with regards to education in the country you chose. You will follow the same steps you did in the tutorial but will include two or three additional indicators from the list below. Please keep the tutorial handy as you complete your assignment so you can use it as a resource. You should be in touch with your group members to each run different analyses that look at various indicators of marginalization. You can each run one indicator.\n",
