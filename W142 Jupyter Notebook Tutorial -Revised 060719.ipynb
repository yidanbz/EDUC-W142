We have created this specific notebook so that you can run code in order to perform data analysis and answer questions aimed at identifying barriers to girls’ education. The process of identifying the most marginalized can be broken down into 3 steps: The first is collecting disaggregated data for key indicators, the next is to identify target groups through analyzing and triangulating data, and the final step is to explore why educational marginalization takes place so that you can come up with an action plan.

    "Disaggregating data allows us to identify specific clusters, patterns and barriers to education. It also allows us to identify the various groups of girls (and boys) who experience the most marginalization.  However, disaggregating gender data is only a first step. This disaggregation should be carried out along with other social categories. It is important to keep in mind that national data patterns may radically differ from global patterns and some gender disaggregated data can be deceiving due to measures used. Therefore data should also be triangulated through collecting (and thereby verifying) data from two or more sources. Data can be triangulated through collecting this information in numeric (through databases and other aggregated or disaggregated sources) and non-numeric form (through interviews, observations, surveys). The goal of triangulating data is to overcome the shortcoming and possible biases of relying on data from one source, which is important in conducting a gender analysis. You will use this tutorial to obtain statistics which you will later triangulate by conducting research on the context of the country of your choice.\n",
